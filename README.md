	Front End Challenge
</h2>

![Application Preview](/print.png)

## ðŸ“™ Overview

As per the [challenge description](https://github.com/juntossomosmais/frontend-challenge/blob/master/README.md), its goal was to turn a wireframe into code, adding improvements if necessary, besides developing the UI/UX for it ourselves. Some of the functionalities added to this application were:

- **Live Search.** See the users you're searching for in real time.
- **User Details.** Check additional information of every user inside their very own route.
- **User Filter.** The sidebar filter displays only the users that fit the region filter selected.
- **Pagination.** Displaying the users in groups of 15 increases the performance of the application.
- **Responsive interface.** It's completely mobile friendly, so it works smoothly on every desktop, smartphone and tablet.

## ðŸ”¨ Process

First of all, a sketch was created, alongside the list of needs and improvements the application could have.

When it came to coding, I realised the fetch from the API informed in the challenge description was not working, so I chose to download the file and leave it inside the project. This is being done by using the Axios lib.
